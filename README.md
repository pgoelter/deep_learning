# Deep Learning

This repository serves as a summary or a look up reference to the deep learning lecture of the HTW Saar (Sommersemester 2021 - Praktische Informatik (applied computer science)).

## Environment Setup

<span style="color:red">**Python version 3.8 is required**</span>.

To execute the code samples in python files or jupyter notebooks, setup a virtual environment with the required packages. The virtual environment can either be done directly via anaconda (environment.yml) or manually by installing the packages via pip.

### Setup with anaconda

1. Make sure an Anaconda distribution is installed on your machine. (either anaconda or miniconda)
2. Create the Anaconda environment with:
   `conda env create -f environment.yml`  
   The environment name is specified on top of the environment.yml and defaults to **DL**
3. Activate the environment with:
   `conda activate DL`

### Setup manually

1. Create a virtual environment of your choice.
2. Activate your environment
3. Install with pip by executing the following:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
